# CardList Component (Scene for a visual component)
The CardList component will be our container that holds many cards. For now we will create a basic 
version of what we are after

## Steps 
### Wireframe/Design 
This should be a vertical list that has a a list name and a container for storing cards

### Component 
#### Structure
* Component
    * List name
    * Card container
        * <card.component.tsx\>
        * ...
        * <card.component.tsx\>

***

### Story 
We will print out the CardList as it is defined in the component. No dynamic properties

***

### BDD Test 
* When we load the CardList to the screen, 
we will see the list name and
we will see 2 Card components with text of "Card 1" and "Card 2"

    Given I have a CardList
    When I look at it
    Then I should see the name of the list
    And I should see 2 cards with the names of 'Card 1' and 'Card 2'
