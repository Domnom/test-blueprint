# board Component (Scene for a visual component)
Holds a bunch of CardList components

### What we are working on
We will be initialising the Board component. The board should have a name and 2 static card-lists
that both contain 2 Cards each 

## Steps 
### Wireframe/Design 
* Design 
*  

### Component 
#### Structure
The board should contain a name and a container that can hold a bunch of card lists

* `Component`
    * `Board name`
    * `CardList container`

***

### Story 
We should have a single board component that should have statically created lists with cards

***

### BDD Test 
* When we load the Board to the screen,
We will see the board name and
We will see 2 card lists and
Each list will have 2 cards each

    Given I have a Board
    When I look at it
    Then I should see the name of the board
    And I should see 2 card lists with the names of 'List 1' and 'List 2'
    And 2 Cards on each list with the names of 'Card 1', 'Card 2', 'Card 3' and 'Card 4'
