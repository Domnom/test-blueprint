# board Component (Scene for a visual component)
Holds a bunch of CardList components

### What we are working on
We will be converting the static values we have set on the board to be dynamic properties.
This should include

* Board name
* listsData

## Steps 
### Wireframe/Design 
* Design 
*  

### Component 
#### Structure
The board should contain a name and a container that can hold a bunch of card lists

* Component
    * Board name
    * CardList container
        * <card-list.component.tsx\>
        * ...
        * <card-list.component.tsx\>


***

### Story 
We should have a single board component that has dynamic props which are editable using storybook knobs


***

### Unit Test
* We will add a proptypes unit test to the Board component
    * name
    * listsData

* The listsData prop should be an optional prop

* The lists data should be an array that contains an object with the following keys
    * name
    * cards (array)
        * id
        * name

* Test what we should render when the listsData that is passed in is
    * Valid - Print the list to the screen
    * Invalid - Skip the list with invalid data
    * Mixed - Print valid and skip invalid
    

***

### BDD Test 
* When we load the Board to the screen,
We will see the board name and
We will see 2 card lists and
Each list will have 2 cards each

    Given I have a Board
    When I look at it
    Then I should see the name of the board
    And I should see 2 card lists with the names of 'List 1' and 'List 2'
    And 2 Cards on each list with the names of 'Card 1', 'Card 2', 'Card 3' and 'Card 4'
