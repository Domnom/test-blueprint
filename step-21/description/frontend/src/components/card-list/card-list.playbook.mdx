# CardList Component (Scene for a visual component)
The CardList component will be our container that holds many cards. 

### What we are working on
We are moving some features from `Board` to the `CardList`

1. We will be letting the `CardList` sort the position of its `Cards`. The will mean we need to implement
    1. constructor -> Initialise the component. Required as we need to initialise this.state which will be used in the next step
    2. static getDerivedStateFromProps -> This is a built-in `React.Component` function that is called before render. It returns a state and the state we are creating
       will be the cardsData from `this.props` BUT in order sorted by card.position
2. Render `Cards` will now read from `this.state` rather than `this.props`
3. Export the component using [React.forwardRef](https://reactjs.org/docs/forwarding-refs.html). This will allow us to set to set a `ref` prop
   from any parent and access the instance methods
4. Implement a `get` instance method to get the orderedCards (the cards from this.state). This will be required for any parent
   that implements this `CardList` as they will have to implement `DragDropContext` which will need access to the child card index positions.

## Steps 
### Wireframe/Design 
This should be a vertical list that has a a list name and a container for storing cards

### Component 
#### Structure
The card list name will be generated by a dynamic property that is passed in when we create the component `<CardList name={dyanmic_name} \>`
and the card container will be generated with an array of cards that will also be passed in via props `<CardList cardsData={[array_of_cards]} \>`

Because the cards data will be an array, we can loop over the array objects (cards) and create an array of `<Card\>` components.
Using the array of card components, we can add them directly to the card container

* Component
    * List name
    * Droppable
        * Card container
            * Draggable
                * <card.component.tsx\>
            * Draggable
                * ...
            * Draggable
                * <card.component.tsx\>

### Story 
We should now be able to have a completely empty card list and a cardlist prefilled with a card list name 
and 2 cards. We will use storybook knobs and let the user change the name of the card list aswell as the card 
data being passed through

The cards in the card list should now be moveable! Unfortunately they do not save their positions...

***

### Unit Test
* We will add a proptypes unit test to the CardList component to test the new properties
    * listId (required)
    * name (required)
    * cardsData (optional)

* The cardsData prop should be optional so check if there are any cards on the screen if the cardsData array is not supplied

* The cardsData array should be an array of objects. The objects should contain the following keys:
    * id
    * name

* We should also make sure that the CardsList component does not break when the provided cardsData array of objects
has the incorrect keys. It should instead return the cards list with as many valid cards as it can create


***

### BDD Test 
* When we load the CardList to the screen, 
we will see the list name and
we will see 2 Card components with text of "Card 1" and "Card 2"

    Given I have a CardList
    When I look at it
    Then I should see the name of the list
    And I should see 2 cards with the names of 'Card 1' and 'Card 2'
