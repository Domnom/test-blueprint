# Card Component (Scene for a visual component)


## Steps 
### Wireframe/Design 
We want the display to be a rectangular box with text inside

***

### Component 
#### Structure
* div
    * card name

#### Properties
* name - Allows us to dynamically set the value of the card name

#### States
There are no states other than default

#### Actions
There are no actions for this component

***

### Story 
We want to see the card in its default state and be able to modify
the content of the card name using storybook knobs

*** 

### Unit Test 
We can now add unit tests to test the PropTypes of the component.
We will do this by using a util function called 'checkProps' which will use the check-prop-types library
to check if the data we are passing through validates with the propTypes static variable in the component

1) Write TDD test and specify expected props. Pass in data and validate.
2) Run tests. Expect the tests to fail as we have not defined the propTypes
3) Open component and add required propTypes
4) Re-run test and expect passing. If not review propTypes in the component and modify to pass tests

***

### BDD Test 
* We want to test if the card that we have created presents some
sort of text to the screen for the client to see. This should be
the default behaviour

    Given I have a card  
    When I look at it  
    Then I should see the card name
