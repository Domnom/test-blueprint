# Card Component (Scene for a visual component)


## Steps 
### Wireframe/Design 
We want the display to be a rectangular box with text inside

***

### Component 
#### Structure
* div
    * card name

#### Properties
* name - Allows us to dynamically set the value of the card name

#### States
There are no states other than default

#### Actions
There are no actions for this component

***

### Story 
We want to see the card in its default state and be able to modify
the content of the card name using storybook knobs

*** 

### Unit Test 
No unit tests are required right now

***

### BDD Test 
* We want to test if the card that we have created presents some
sort of text to the screen for the client to see. This should be
the default behaviour

    Given I have a card  
    When I look at it  
    Then I should see the card name
