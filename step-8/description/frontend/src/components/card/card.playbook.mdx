# Card Component (Scene for a visual component)


## Steps 
### Wireframe/Design

***

### Component 
#### Structure
* div
    * card name

#### Properties
We will not need any properties right now

#### States
There are no states other than default

#### Actions
There are no actions for this component

***

### Story 
We will show the card in its default state with basic text

*** 

### Unit Test 
No unit tests are required right now

***

### BDD Test 
* We want to test if the card that we have created presents some
sort of text to the screen for the client to see. This should be
the default behaviour

    Given I have a card  
    When I look at it  
    Then I should see the card name
