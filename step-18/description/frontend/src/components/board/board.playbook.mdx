# board Component (Scene for a visual component)
Holds a bunch of CardList components

### What we are working on
We now want to add the ability to re-order card lists in a board. Just like the card-lists, we will be using `react-beautiful-dnd` to move things around.

The components that we will be using from this library are:  
`DragDropContext` -> The root for all draggable/droppable elements  
`Draggable` -> A wrapper for elements that require the draggable functionality  
`Droppable` -> A wrapper for elements that are able to receive draggables

First we will need to remove the `DragDropContext` that exists inside the `CardList Component`. This is because we are going to move the `DragDropContext` to
the board as the board is going to need to implement `Draggable` and `Droppable`

We will then wrap the card list container up with the `Droppable` component. This will let cards drop onto the container 

Next the card lists will now need to be wrapped up with the `Draggable` component  Because we want to make our `<CardList \>` components draggable, 
we will need to also include a listId for each card in the listsData property. With the listId, we will be able to identify which card list is being moved

Finally we should include the `DragDropContext` component as far up the  HTML tree as possible. 
The best place for this is wrapping it around the `Droppable` component

Now that the drag and drop is done, we will need to update the `listsData` that is passed into the `Board`
We will need to add an `id` property to the `listsData` objects so we can uniquely identify each dragging card list

We should now have the ability to move card lists around and cards between card lists. Note, they **DO NOT** save their positions, we will get to that in
another chapter
 



## Steps 
### Wireframe/Design 
* Design 
*  

### Component 
#### Structure
The board should contain a name and a container that can hold a bunch of card lists

* Component
    * Board name
    * `DragDropContext`
        * `Droppable`
            * CardList container
                * `Draggable`
                    * <card-list.component.tsx\>
                * `Draggable`
                    * ...
                * `Draggable`
                    * <card-list.component.tsx\>

### Story 
We should have a single board component that has dynamic props which are editable using storybook knobs

The card lists should also be moveable and should only land within the card list container

***

### Unit Test
* We will add a proptypes unit test to the Board component
    * name
    * listsData

* The listsData prop should be an optional prop

* The lists data should be an array that contains an object with the following keys
    * id
    * name
    * cards (array)
        * id
        * name

* Test what we should render when the listsData that is passed in is
    * Valid - Print the list to the screen
    * Invalid - Skip the list with invalid data
    * Mixed - Print valid and skip invalid
    

***

### BDD Test 
* When we load the Board to the screen,
We will see the board name and
We will see 2 card lists and
Each list will have 2 cards each

    Given I have a Board
    When I look at it
    Then I should see the name of the board
    And I should see 2 card lists with the names of 'List 1' and 'List 2'
    And 2 Cards on each list with the names of 'Card 1', 'Card 2', 'Card 3' and 'Card 4'
