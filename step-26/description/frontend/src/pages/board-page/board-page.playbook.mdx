# Board page component (Scene for a visual component)


### What we are working on
We will be adding our first page to this app.  

First we will need to modify the index.tsx file. This is the main file that will boot our app so 
we will need to include the `board-page` component so we can see it.

This page will be accessible by runnning the command:

```
yarn run start:dev
```

This should use the webpack-dev-server which will automatically open the app in your
chosen browser or you can navigate to the default url of

```
http://localhost:8080
```

The app will use the `Board` component that we defined in the previous chapters and 
it will be loaded with static list data we will define inside the `board-page` file

Tests for this `board-page` will use a new library called `Cypress`.

`Cypress` is used for testing e2e flows. Right now our `board-page` only utilizes the 
basic abilities of the `Board` component but it will be useful when we add api requests to
populate data or authorisation rules when reading and writing to the `Board`

## Steps
