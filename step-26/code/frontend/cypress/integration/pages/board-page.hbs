    Scenario: As a user opening the board page
        Given I navigate to the board page
        Then I should see a board with 3 lists
        And the first list should have 2 cards called 'Card 1' and 'Card 2'
        And the second list should have 1 card called 'Card 3'
        And the third list should be empty

    Scenario: As a user moving a card below another card in the same list
        Given I have a list with 2 cards 'Card 1' and 'Card 2'
        When I drag the card 'Card 1' below the card 'Card 2'
        Then the cards should have swapped positions

    Scenario: As a user moving a card above another card in the same list
        Given I have a list with 2 cards 'Card 1' and 'Card 2'
